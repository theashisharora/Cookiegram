# Contributing to Cookiegram

Welcome to Cookiegram! This is a capstone project with 5 team members.

## Branch Structure

This project follows a structured branching strategy to facilitate collaboration:

### Initial Setup

If the `dev` and `feature` branches don't exist yet, run the setup script:
```bash
./setup-branches.sh
```

### Main Branches

- **`main`** - The production-ready branch containing stable, release-ready code
- **`dev`** - The development branch where features are integrated and tested before merging to main
- **`feature`** - The feature branch used for developing new features

## Workflow

1. Create feature branches from `dev` for new features
2. Develop and test your features in feature branches
3. Merge completed features into `dev` for integration testing
4. Once stable, merge `dev` into `main` for release

## Team Collaboration

- Always pull the latest changes before starting new work
- Create descriptive commit messages
- Test your code before pushing
- Review code from team members

Happy coding! ðŸš€
